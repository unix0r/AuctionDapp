# AuctionDapp
Decentralized Blockchain Auction Application
This project implements the concepts for decentralized auction houses of my masterthesis for the Hochschule Furtwangen University.
The work is influenced by the examples of the solidity documentation: <https://solidity.readthedocs.io/en/latest/solidity-by-example.html#blind-auction>
And examples of the mastering ethereum book: <https://github.com/ethereumbook/ethereumbook/tree/develop/code/auction_dapp>

For a copy of the masterthesis (in german) feel free to contact me.
